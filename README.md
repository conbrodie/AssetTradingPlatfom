###### Setup MySQL Database

Locate DB_Setup.sql in the scripts folder and create the database. You will need either MariaSQL or SQL already setup.

###### Modify local variables and database connection variables

2. Locate db.prop and network.prop inside the resources folder.

- Modify the localhost as required in network.prop
- Modify the items as identified in db.prop

Start the server by running the server server.java under src/server. Start the client by running app.java under src/client. All necessary java frameworks can be found in the lib folder.
