#1. defect in Chart - private XYDataset createTradedSeriesDataset() method - had to adjust
    SELL and BUY datetime values so they would be different else graph does not show them.
    Need a better solution!

#2. defect in MainFrame - private boolean refreshAssets() method - not working as expected.

#3. added client and server properties to resources. Mainly initialDelay and Period values. Also added a property
    is allow the schedulers not to be run.

#4. ?
